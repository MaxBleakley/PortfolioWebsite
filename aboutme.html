    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">I studied a level 3 extended diploma in IT at SERC completing this course with the grades D*D*D, some of the modules I found most interesting included 
            cyber-security, website development, IT Service Delivery and games development. I have now progressed into an undergraduate degree in computing with cyber security and computer forensics
            at Edge Hill University.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I have participated in several projects, one of which was the configuration of a LAN network using enterprise equipment including Cisco 
    Catalyst network switches allowing for basic file sharing capabilities between devices. 
    Additionally, I configured a basic PiHole network adblock using a Raspberry Pi 4 to filter traffic entering and exiting my home network on all devices including smart TV's etc. 
    This Project was later discontinued as I repurposed it into a server using enginx to host a website I had created to demonstrate the functionality of a password manager I developed 
    <br>
    <br>
    The next notable project i created was a 2D RPG game which drew heavy inspiration from games such as Stardew Valley. This game was created in the unity game engine and primarily
    programmed in C sharp and had features such as inventory management (including drag and drop functionality), monetary/shop systems, crop growing/planting mechanics and NPC's with
    interactable dialogue among other features.
    <br>
    <br>
     Finally, I worked with a fellow student at SERC to configure over 100 lenovo tablets working for the local city council to aid them in an initiative to help connect vulnerable 
     and those who are socially isolated. This included the creation of detailed, yet non-technical guidance documents, assesment of user needs and communication, primarily with the 
     local council who requested our assistance. </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    My primary hobbies at the moment include reading a variety of books including fantisy, philosophy and technology books. Two of the books I have read recently that I find most
    fascinating is the meditations of Marcus Aurelius which is a famed book surrounding the philosophy stoicism. However, despite being a famed stoic text, these meditations were 
    never meant to be published and instead are just copies of various thoughts this roman emporer had at the time of their writting. The next book I have found captivating recently
    is Hello World by Hannah Fry which acts as a deep dive into the use of algorithms in all aspects of our world from justice and policing to healthcare and commerce. Both of these
    books are ones I would highly recommend.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am also a massive fan of video games and play a variety of genres. I primarily play Overwatch as of the moment and am in the process of trying to regain my former role as a 
    Master support player in the competitive scene of the game. I have been a life-long gamer and don't see my enjoyment of the media ending any time soon as I find it an extremely 
    interesting way to convey deep, emotional story's such as the one's shown through the God Of War franchise.
    <br>
    <br>
    Recently I stopped one of my other long standing hobbies which was wrestling, I stopped this year after roughly 4-5 years of training which also included MMA training with wrestling. 
    However, I do wish to try the sport of indoor rock climbing and my interest has been piqued recently by this activity and I plan on starting this soon!
